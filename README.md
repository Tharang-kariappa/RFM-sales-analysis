# RFM analysis for sales data

## Introduction
In today's competitive business landscape, understanding customer behavior and making data-driven decisions is essential for sustained growth and profitability. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a powerful tool that helps organizations gain insights into their customer base, enabling them to tailor marketing strategies and optimize resource allocation. This analysis method leverages data on the recency of customer purchases, the frequency of their transactions, and the monetary value of their spending. By segmenting customers into distinct groups based on these three key metrics, businesses can better target their marketing efforts, enhance customer retention, and improve overall performance

## Aims and objectives

In this project is would like to explore the following:

- Group the sales by Product line and figure out which product line made the most revenue.
-  In which year was the most revenue generated.
-  Which were the best months for sales per year.
-  Which product line sells the most in best month.
-  Who are the best customers (This could be best answered with RFM)
-  What products are most often sold together.

## Steps of the project
- Obtain the data required for the analysis and importing it to the database
- Inspecting the imported data
- Exploratory data analysis
- Conclusions

## Conclusion

After performing the analysis the conclusion i came up with were:

- Classic Cars were the best product line they have followed by Vintage cars.
- 2004 was the year they made the most revenue, but in the dataset they did not have a full year operation in 2005 hence the revenue was pretty low.
- The Medium sized deals generated the most revenue hence focusig the marketing on the medium sized deals will help generate more revenue.
- In both the years 2003 and 2004 ,November was the month they generated the most revenue and classic cars was the product line that sold the most that month.
- To figure out who the best customers are i divided them into categories they are "Lost Customers","Slipping away-Cannot lose","New Customers","Potential churners","active Customers" and "Loyal Customers"
